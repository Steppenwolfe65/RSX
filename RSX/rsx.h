* \mainpage <b>The RSX cipher</b>
* \section intro_sec Welcome
* The RSX (Rijndael Shake eXtended) cipher, is a hybrid of Rijndael (AES) and the Keccak SHAKE-256 extended output function. \n
* The cipher has four modes, AES128 and AES256, which are the standard AES configurations, and two extended modes, RSX256 and RSX512. \n
* In extended mode, the key schedule has been replaced by SHAKE-256, which can safely produce a larger round-key array,  \n
* enabling an increased number of mixing rounds.
* The extended cSHAKE implementation can also be used, by passing the custumization string and length, through the keyparams structure. \n
* AES-128 has a round count of 10, AES-256 is 14 rounds, RSX-256 is 22 rounds, and RSX-512, which uses a 512 bit cipher input-key, uses 30 rounds. \n
* Increasing the number of rounds, increases the amount of diffusion applied to the state, which makes rijndael harder to break with differentially based attacks,  \n
* and by increasing the key size, maintains a high margin of security against future attacks by quantum computers.
* 
* \section Implementation
* The base cipher, Rijndael, and the extended form of the cipher, can operate using one of the three provided cipher modes of operation: \n
* Electronic Code Book mode (ECB), which can be used for testing or creating more complex algorithms,  \n
* a segmented integer counter (CTR), and the Cipher Block Chaining mode (CBC). \n
* This implementation has both a C reference, and an implementation that uses the AES-NI instructions. \n
* The AES-NI implementation can be enabled by adding the RSX_AESNI_ENABLED constant to your preprocessor definitions. \n
* The AES128 and AES256 implementations along with the CBC, CTR, and CBC modes are tested using vectors from SP800-38a. \n
* SP800-38a: <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-38a.pdf">Block Cipher Modes of Operations</a> \n
* See the documentation and the aes_kat.h tests for usage examples.
